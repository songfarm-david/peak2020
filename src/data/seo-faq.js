        q: `What is SEO?`,
        a: `<p>SEO, short for Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of ranking highly in the organic search results for keywords that are relevant to your business. If done right, your website or pages of your website will appear in the organic search results section of the search engine results page (SERPs) of search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.</p>
        <p>Effective SEO is achieved by optimizing your website and its content to be the preferred result of search engines like Google for certain keywords or keyword groups that are valuable to your target audience and relevant to your business. You wouldn’t want to rank highly for just any keyword but only the keywords that drive the most relevant traffic to your website where you can convert visitors into customers.</p>
        <p>Google, and other search engines, strive to provide their users with the best possible result to match the user’s search query. SEO, in short, is positioning your website to be the best choice in the eyes of Google for the keywords that matter most to your business.</p>

        q: `Does my business need SEO?`,
        a: `<p>The short answer: yes. <a href="https://searchengineland.com/organic-search-responsible-for-53-of-all-site-traffic-paid-15-study-322298" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Over 50% of a site’s traffic comes from organic search</a> whereas paid ads only account for about 15%. So it doesn’t matter if you’re a national chain or a small local business, caring about SEO has a big impact on your visibility online and the amount of traffic your website will receive.</p>
        <p>If you have a website and would like to be found organically online, without paying for every click with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, then SEO is how you do that. While increasing ones SEO does carry with it an investment in time and money, ranking on the first page of Google means 24/7 visibility online for months or years to come.</p> 
        <p>While you could pay for clicks by advertising on search engines, this strategically only works when you are paying for the ads. Once you stop, then you’re removed from the search results page and back at square one. Paying for ads does not help your SEO though it can help spread awareness of your business. SEO, however, is much more durable and sustainable, and can produce long term visibility for your business online.</p>

        q: `How does SEO work?`,
        a: `<p>SEO has to do with organic search results, not paid listing. In that way, each search engine uses an algorithm to decipher and decide how to rank pages and what pages should rank the highest based on many factors. Google alone uses over 200 ranking factors when deciding which website pages should rank highest in search results.</p>
        <p>Some of the most critical factors include relevancy - how relevant a website is to a particular search query. Another important factor is the trust and authority of a website. That is, is the website reputable and can it be trusted or is it a low-quality spammy website that is likely to provide the user with a bad user experience.</p>
        <p>These and many more factors combine to produce the top organic search results. SEO is the process of improving and optimizing these factors over time in order to be considered the most relevant and authoritative result for a given search query.</p>

        q: `Why isn’t my website ranking on Google?`,
        a: `<p>It’s likely that your website is ranking on Google but you’re not on the first page (or maybe even the 2nd or 3rd..) so it appears that you’re not ranking at all. This could be for a number of reasons but the most likely answer is that your website isn’t optimized well.</p>
        <p>For instance, your content may be lacking the proper optimization in order to be correctly understood by Google’s crawl-bots, so Google and other search engines may not know what to rank you for.</p>
        <p>It could be that your content isn’t particularly special or useful and other websites are doing a better job of providing visitors with a valuable and useful user experience (Google knows how people engage with websites and use this as one of their ranking factors).</p>
        <p>Additionally, it could be that your website does not have enough authority in your niche to compete against other websites that are already ranking well and have already invested in their SEO strategy.</p>
        <p>There are also technical reasons that your website may not be ranking such as your site being blocked from being crawled, which you’ll need to investigate or enlist the help of an experienced SEO.</p>
        <p>None of this to say that you can’t turn this around and make it to the first page but it will require that you take a good, honest look at your SEO strategy and consider making an investment in improving it.</p>

        q: `How long does it take to rank on Google?`,
        a: `<p>The answer to this question is always: <em>it depends</em>. The reason for this is due to many different factors including the type of business website you have and the type of keywords you want to rank for. Typically, the more competitive a keyword, the more difficult it will be to rank on the first page of Google for it. This is especially true if you have a young or brand new website with little or no domain authority.</p>
        <p>Typically, it can take 6 months to a year to rank for more average competition keywords while ranking locally for <em>electricians in [location]</em> could take only a few months. Trying to rank for highly competitive keywords, like laptops can potentially take years. It really depends on the strength of your website’s SEO and the market that you’re competing in.</p> 
        <p>Based on how Google’s ranking algorithm currently works, you have to earn your spot at the top and this requires following best practices, creating a great user experience for your visitors, and building up your authority online by sticking to your strategy and being consistent in providing good value to visitors of your website.</p>

        q: `Should I do pay-per-click ads (PPC), SEO, or both?`,
        a: `<p>Deciding on whether to invest in pay-per-click ads versus investing in an SEO strategy typically depends on long and short term goals of the business and what their online marketing budget is.</p>
        <p>In any case, it’s a good idea to balance various marketing channels so as to not be reliant on any one source of traffic. When it comes to generating more leads and traffic for local business, it’s recommended to use a multi-prong approach including a mixture of SEO and PPC ads.</p>
        <p>Since organic search results tend to drive the greatest amount of site traffic versus paid ads, a balance weighted in favor of SEO should be considered while at the same time, PPC ads can be used strategically to further drive traffic and brand engagement.</p>
