# TODO

1. Add a good modern CSS reset 
2. Address SEO concerns
3. remove .hey-now class from contact page/ remove WPForms
4. Wire up forms, newsletter
5. review copy
6. configure domains and dns


* Make index.js show slug /home
* Once you have imported WP Menus, check that /sitemap
* Verify manifest.json / PWA
* all routes that were redirected to homepage - that have something to do with service - should be redirected to the /services/ page, I think

1. wanna add a scrolling line at the top of page like [this one](https://www.ppchero.com/how-should-you-formulate-your-ppc-strategy/), on blog pages
2. look into phone systems
