* Make index.js show slug /home
* Once you have imported WP Menus, check that /sitemap
* Verify manifest.json / PWA
* all routes that were redirected to homepage - that have something to do with service - should be redirected to the /services/ page, I think

1. wanna add a scrolling line at the top of page like [this one](https://www.ppchero.com/how-should-you-formulate-your-ppc-strategy/), on blog pages
